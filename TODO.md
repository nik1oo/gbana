- Describe the signals and logic of each cycle.
- Make sure all the timing diagrams include all the relevant signals.
- Figure out the bus width and latency (wait cycles) of every memory region.
- Figure how wide the bus for each memory region is, and encode it, so that the right bus cycle can be used.
- Write tests for all the different cycles.
- Write procedures that execute all the different cycles.
- Move each signal to its corresponding component.
- Make all functions in singleton classes private to file, except their initialization and tick functions.
